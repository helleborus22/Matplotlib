# Matplotlib
 Module 5 Challenge

In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals’ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The notebook generates a summary DataFrame, that contains:
All drug regimens and
all summary statistics (mean, median, variance, std. deviation  or SEM)

✓ Two bar plots are successfully generated depicting the total number of measurements taken for each treatment regimen using both plotting methods:
pandas.DataFrame.plot() and
matplotlib.pyplot()

✓ Two pie plots are successfully generated depicting the distribution of male versus female mice using both plotting methods:
pandas.DataFrame.plot() and
matplotlib.pyplot()

✓ The notebook calculates all of the following for all four drug regimens:
Quartiles,
IQR,
Outlier boundaries, and
All potential outliers

✓ A box and whisker plot is successfully generated for the final tumor volume, and meets all of the following criteria:
All four treatment regimens are on the same plot and
potential outlier data points have a custom style or color

✓ A line plot is successfully generated for the time point versus tumor volume for a single mouse treated with Capomulin

✓ A scatter plot is successfully generated depicting  mouse weight versus average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen

✓ The correlation coefficient is calculated for mouse weight versus average tumor volume

✓ The linear regression model is calculated for mouse weight versus average tumor volume

✓ The linear regression model has been plotted over the scatter plot depicting mouse weight versus average tumor volume 

✓ The notebook contains three observations or insights about the data
